Alacpretty is a work-in-progress terminal UI that allows programmers using Alacritty to dynamically change their terminal settings. Still plenty of things left to be done, but I expect a stable version to be out sometime in October of 2020.

Hello everyone who is following this repo for the first time! My apologies for the delay in getting a stable version out - I've been very busy at work - but I expect to have a week or two off some time in December, whereof I will spend finishing up Alacpretty. I will also update the README later today with installation instructions as well as directions on how to use Alacpretty as is. Thanks for your patience!

Hello again everyone! I apologize for the snail's pace as work has been super busy and I honestly did not expect this many stars! I'm very grateful that so many people are taking an interest in this pet project of mine so it does pain me that, as it currently exists, Alacpretty isn't very stable; however, I've booked two weeks off from work for the latter half of December to complete this project along with the documentation! Thank you everyone for your patience!
